# Fine-Tuning-Yolov3

-- This repository explains how you can fine tune the Yolov3 model with your custom dataset. 

## The outline of my work is as folllows: 
  1- Collect your images
  2- Annotate with LabelImg (This is what I have used.)
  3- Modify the configuration files of darknet YOLO according to the dataset
  4- Train with Google Colab (Fine-tuning)
